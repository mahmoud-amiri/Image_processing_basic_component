# Image Processing in MATLAB

This repository contains a collection of basic image processing scripts written in MATLAB. Each script demonstrates a different image processing technique.

## Introduction

This repository is intended for anyone interested in learning about basic image processing techniques using MATLAB. The scripts cover a variety of operations such as filtering, edge detection, morphological operations, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, you will need MATLAB installed on your machine. You can download MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2021b or later

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mahmoud-amiri/Image_processing_basic_component.git
```
